# Bharat-Hirald-Newspaper-Analysis

Bharat Herald, saw print circulation collapse from 1.2M → 560K (2019–2024). The pandemic accelerated the digital shift, but their 2021 e-paper pilot failed due to poor mobile usability.

 I built a 3-view Power BI Dashboard:
 ➡️ Overall performance (circulation, wastage, profitability)
 ➡️ Revenue analysis (categories, revenue per copy, city-wise)
 ➡️ Digital performance (engagement, bounce, readiness, cost per user)
Plus, solved 6 ad-hoc SQL business requests to support decision-making. Find these detailed SQL queries in my GitHub repo.

💡 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
- Lucknow → most profitable city despite low circulation
- Patna → contributed 13% of total revenue in 2024
- Kanpur → highest readiness score (75.1) but poor engagement (Outlier)→ urgent UX fix
- Mobile App beta → most promising platform (61.8% engagement)

🚀 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝:
 ✅ Phased digital rollout (Kanpur → Ranchi → Patna)
 ✅ UX/UI improvements to reduce bounce rate
 ✅ Revenue recovery via subscription bundling + advertiser ROI tracking
 ✅ Local influencers for regional digital credibility
